# Document-Retireval-System
Welcome to our Document Retrieval Engine! We've developed a powerful tool to extract specific passages or paragraphs from various document types (including Word, PDF, and Images). Our solution is designed to efficiently retrieve information from multiple sections, such as inclusions, exclusions, conditions, definitions, extensions, and more.

**Key Features:**

**Multi-Document Support:** Our system can handle many document types, making it versatile for diverse use cases.

**Section-Based Extraction:** Seamlessly extract entire passages or paragraphs from designated sections (e.g., inclusions, exclusions) based on user queries.

**Stemming and Tokenization:** We've implemented Martin Porter's 'Porter Stemmer' for stemming and utilize standard tokenization techniques to ensure accurate and efficient text processing.

**Customizable Search Queries:** Users can specify their search queries to pinpoint the needed information.

**User-Friendly UI:** We've also developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that ensures a seamless experience for users. The UI simplifies querying and retrieving specific information from complex documents, making it accessible to many users.

**Programming Languages and Tools:**

The core functionality of our document retrieval engine is coded from scratch in Python Programming Language.
We've leveraged the NLTK Normalization Library for text normalization.
Stemming is accomplished using Martin Porter's 'Porter Stemmer' for enhanced search capabilities.
Tokenization is performed using NLTK Tokenization Library for accurate text processing.
Datasets: Automobile & Property Insurance Dataset
